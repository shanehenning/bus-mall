# Marketing Research Team
As a Marketing Research Team, I want to discern which possible products of ours would interest an audience most.  

As a Marketing Research Team, I want users to choose their preferences over other possible products.  But I want it to be simple as well.  Thus there should be choices--but few choices--from which the user may choose.

As a Marketing Research Team, I want this selection process to be as unbiased as possible, so I don’t want a user to see any numbers starting to add up and have that influence their selection process.  Therefore, any results to be displayed should not be shown until at minimum, 25 selections have been made.  Furthermore, I believe we will offer such an enrapturing system that users will want to continue selecting items for hours until they’d ever dream of looking at any trends.  So they also need the option to be able to keep clicking away without ever having to be bothered by any collected data.

As a Marketing Research Team, I want to know specifically how popular an item is.  I don’t want to know if Item A was chosen 14 times and Item B was chosen 11 times unless I know that Item A was chosen over Item B 14 times.  So we need to track how often products are displayed, and what percentage of those displays are they chosen.

# Developer
As a Developer, I want to collect various selections made by a user.  I want to track how many selections were made, and what percentage of times a product was selected compared to how many times it was displayed.

As a Developer, I want to streamline the process and ensure that as soon as one selection is made, an immediate offering of another choice is given.

As a Developer, I want to display the data collected after a set period of 25 selections, with the option to continue making selections for over-achieving users.

# Focus Group Participant
As a Focus Group Participant, I want it (whatever “it” may be) to work.

As a Focus Group Participant, I want to see unique products that have an intrigue factor.  But knowing that intrigue will wear off after I see an item a few times, I don’t want to have to click for eternity before I can see my results.
